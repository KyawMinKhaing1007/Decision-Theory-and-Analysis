##### Load library
```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse,knitr,DiagrammeR)
```

##### Create a Payoff Table

```{r}
payoff_table <- tibble(
  Treatment = c("Control", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2"),
  Outcome_1 = c(4.17, 6.11, 5.53),
  Outcome_2 = c(5.58, 4.50, 5.80),
  Outcome_3 = c(5.18, 4.61, 5.28)
)

# View the payoff table
payoff_table
```

##### MAXIMAX Approach (Optimistic Approach)

```{r}
# MAXIMAX Approach - Optimistic Approach
maximax_payoff <- payoff_table %>%
  mutate(Max_Payoff = pmap_dbl(list(Outcome_1, Outcome_2, Outcome_3), max)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Max_Payoff))

maximax_payoff
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
